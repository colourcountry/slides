Show a static page at /slide/*
Show a Slide at /slide/<name>, fully unrolled
Create a Slide from an indented text file
Allow CSS at /slide/<name>?css=<url> (just pass into HTML)
Highlight any Slide at /slide/<name>?focus=<name>
Click on a Slide to open it as HTML, fully unrolled
Where a Slide name begins [<id>], allow [<id>] only wherever full <name> expected.
    - Also allow autogenerated ids in the form [2]. 
Include Slide IDs as inlines but don't display by default (CSS)
'Smart' unrolling
    - unrolls whole generations, until unrolling again would break the limit
Line count limit at /slide/<name>?lines=8. Error if will not fit in limit.
Next link
    - Stay on same page/slide, focus traverses tree
Prev link as next
In link for ununrolled slides
---
Keyboard shortcuts:
    - left arrow = prev
    - down arrow = in
    - right arrow = next
    - space = in otherwise next
Trace of parent pages (note focus should auto-next)
Out link
Keyboard shortcuts:
    - up arrow = out
    - space = in otherwise next otherwise out
Splitting a slide across pages at /slide/<name>?page=2
    - split before unroll, may now be able to unroll further on individual slides
    - needs more thought :(
Next rule with paging
<<< 1.0
Tree pruning - suppress individual links
    - note when a link is suppressed the destination should not appear in unrolled form either
Tree pruning - suppress all links from a slide - force traversal of next branch
Recap suppression
Link reordering
Different list styles - numbered - with slide/<name>?style=
Different list styles - graphics (side arrow)
Different list styles - multi-generation - org chart
Different list styles - multi-generation - mind map
Allow slide names to give hints to parameters, id becomes URL fragment: [<id>?style=]
Restart existing presentation incorporating current decisions (pruning, styles, etc)
Export presentation to PDF
Flash card mode (show title only, then full slide)
