Presentables
    [introduction] What is a Presentable?
        The problem with presentations
            A presentation is a fixed sequence of visuals prepared beforehand
            incremental bubbles:Need to second-guess your audience
                What do they already know?
                How much detail do they need?
                What views or visual aids will help them?
                What might they ask at the end?
            incremental boxes:Coping strategies are ingrained
                Fleshing out slides with notes
                Adding extra "backup" slides at the end
                Ditching the visuals entirely
            Current Web slide frameworks have the same heritage
                subtitle: rvl.io, prezi.com...
                Still expect you to prepare your presentation beforehand
                The requirement to be online is not always realistic
            Why do we live with this?
                Tools like PowerPoint reimplement older technologies
                Transparencies, overhead projection...
                With physical slides, manipulating the deck is cumbersome
        Let's rediscover an older tradition

    Presenting is storytelling
        What does a storyteller do?
            Draws on a body of knowledge
            Picks out a meaningful path
            Explores topics deeply, goes off on tangents, skips sections
            Encourages the audience to ask questions
            Evolves the story through the telling
            Puts on a memorable event

                Any entry can have children
                Entries have an associated type for styling

                Draw down more information from the Net if online
                No need for "just in case" slides
                Edit slides during the performance
                Save from the browser
                Submit changes to an online repository

                CSS3 provides rich styles and transitions

    How to use a Presentable
        A single self-contained HTML page
            Open from Web, local file, e-mail...
            Follow the story with ← →
            Or go off-road with + - or direct click
        Story is a route through a content cache
            Content cache is a slice from the body of knowledge
            Contains all slides you're likely to need
            If online, download extra slides into cache as you go
        Basic editing capabilities
            Press Escape to see the content cache
            Edit text and slide types, add new slides
            Good for correcting mistakes on the road
            More powerful editor planned server side
        New button
            Create new Presentables without needing a server
            Share embedded code at will
        Save button
            Saves current state of story
            Includes content cache
        Not just for presentations?
            Storybooks
            Flashcards
                Press "r" to see a random slide
                Use incremental slides to hide the solution
