Presentable
    [introduction] Building on tradition
        A slide deck is a prepared sequence of visuals
            Tools like PowerPoint reimplement older technologies (transparencies, OHP)
            Even Web-based slide frameworks (rvl.io, prezi.com) have the same heritage
        bubbles:Need to second-guess your audience
            What do they already know?
            How much detail do they need?
            What views or visual aids will help them?
            What might they ask at the end?
        boxes:Coping strategies are ingrained
            Fleshing out slides with notes
            Adding extra "backup" slides at the end
            Ditching the visuals entirely
    transition:We need to rediscover an older tradition

    [demo] transition:Press ↓ now!
        style: background-color: black
        subtitle: Or press → if you tried that already
        transition: You expanded the presentation to a deeper level of detail
            style: background-color: black
            Entries ending with … have more detail to explore
            Pressing ↑ removes the added slides and returns you to the higher level
            Press ↑ twice now and go back through the first section
    Presentation is really storytelling
        What does a storyteller do?
            Draws on a body of knowledge
            Picks out a meaningful path
            Approaches the same topic in different ways
            Explores topics deeply, goes off on tangents, skips sections
            Encourages the audience to ask questions
            Evolves the story through the telling
            Puts on a memorable event
        transition:So a presentation tool should be a storytelling aid
        ol:What does a storytelling aid need?
            A body of knowledge to draw from
            An intuitive way to navigate
            The ability to switch between views of content
            Tight feedback loops with the audience
            Impactful presentation
    ol:How Presentable does it
        The body of knowledge is a mind map
            Trivially simple structure
            Tree structure or mind map composed of entries
            Any text entry can have children
            Master set stored on server
            Pull off any subtree and save as a single HTML file
        Tree navigation provides wayfinding
            Skip over subtrees
            Reorder children (not yet)
        Views provide different visual effects
            Swap between any of these views dynamically
            Most layouts are really pure text
                unordered or ordered list
                    Crackers
                    Biscuits
                    Cookies
                    Brownies
            Typed entries provide more layout options
