This is a Presentable
    [introduction] Building on tradition
        A slide deck is a prepared sequence of visuals
            Tools like PowerPoint reimplement older technologies (transparencies, OHP)
            Even Web-based slide frameworks (rvl.io, prezi.com) have the same heritage
        incremental bubbles:Need to second-guess your audience
            What do they already know?
            How much detail do they need?
            What views or visual aids will help them?
            What might they ask at the end?
        incremental boxes:Coping strategies are ingrained
            Fleshing out slides with notes
            Adding extra "backup" slides at the end
            Ditching the visuals entirely
    transition:We need to rediscover an older tradition

    Presentation is storytelling
        What does a storyteller do?
            Draws on a body of knowledge
            Picks out a meaningful path
            Explores topics deeply, goes off on tangents, skips sections
            Encourages the audience to ask questions
            Evolves the story through the telling
            Puts on a memorable event
        transition p:So a presentation tool is a storytelling aid
            subtitle:
        ol:What does a storytelling aid need?
            A body of knowledge to draw from
            A way to navigate this knowledge
            Flexibility to respond to the audience
            Impactful presentation
    ol:Implementing the idea
        Body of knowledge → mind map
            Tree structure composed of entries
            Any entry can have children
            Entries have an associated type for styling
        Wayfinding → tree navigation
            Skip over subtrees
            Reorder children (not yet)
        Feedback → navigate, edit and save
            Draw down more information from the Net if online
            No need for "just in case" slides
            Edit slides during the performance
            Save from the browser
            Submit changes to an online repository
        Impact → HTML5
            CSS3 provides rich styles and transitions
            Display images, video
            Client can build diagrams with CSS and SVG
            Different views → layouts and types
                Pure text layouts
                    banana split
                    apple pie
