This is a Presentable
    [introduction] What's wrong with presentations
        A presentation is a fixed sequence of visuals
            Tools like PowerPoint reimplement older technologies
                subtitle: transparencies, overhead projection...
                With physical slides, manipulating the deck is cumbersome
            Web-based slide frameworks have the same heritage
                subtitle: rvl.io, prezi.com...
                Still expect you to prepare your presentation beforehand
                Requirement to be online is not always realistic
        incremental bubbles:Need to second-guess your audience
            What do they already know?
            How much detail do they need?
            What views or visual aids will help them?
            What might they ask at the end?
        incremental boxes:Coping strategies are ingrained
            Fleshing out slides with notes
            Adding extra "backup" slides at the end
            Ditching the visuals entirely
        We need to rediscover an older tradition

            Press ↑ twice now and go back through the first section
    Presentation is storytelling
        What does a storyteller do?
            Draws on a body of knowledge
            Picks out a meaningful path
            Explores topics deeply, goes off on tangents, skips sections
            Encourages the audience to ask questions
            Evolves the story through the telling
            Puts on a memorable event
