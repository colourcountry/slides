                Return to overview mode to see your changes
                You can also unroll in overview mode
            Why is that useful?
                You don't have to decide levels of detail before the presentation
                If your audience is really interested in a topic, you can deep dive right there
                    No need to customize presentations, just bring all your slides and make decisions as you go
                    More sleep on long flights!
            Press − to roll up one level of detail
                If you run out of time, you can skip whole sections this way
                after: ...or if the audience gets bored...
